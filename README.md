# Config Files
Most config files I use. I welcome suggestions :)

## Reasons for specific Programs
* qtile: includes systray + statusbar, proper fullscreen
  * exwm: too buggy & single threaded (High CPU Load), slow startup, ugly windows 
  * dwm: needs external script for statusbar, needs compiling, python easier than C
  * xmonad: no systray, no statusbar, GHC (500mb) dependency
* emacs: evil>vim, many functions (eg mpd client, file manager, terminal), one config file for everything
* zsh: completion system
* urxvt
  * st, xterm: no line wrap
  * vte: no image preview (ranger)
